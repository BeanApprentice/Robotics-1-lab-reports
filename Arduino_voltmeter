/* 
  Uses the analogRead function to obtain a bit value from an analog input pin,  
  which is then converted into a voltage value to be printed to the serial monitor. 
  This conversion from bit value to voltage is based on a proportional relationship, where 
  each volt is equal to 204.6 bits. This essentially makes the arduino into a volt meter.
