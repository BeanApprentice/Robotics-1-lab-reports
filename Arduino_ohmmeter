/* 
  This program allows the arduino to measure the resistance of a resistor by placing it in series 
  with a reference resistor with a known, fixed value. The unknown resistance goes from 5V to an 
  analog input pin, and the reference resistor, with a resistance of 1000 ohms, goes from the 
  analog input pin to ground. This creates a voltage divider, and the output of this divider 
  is read by the analog pin and used to calculate the unknown resistance by using the properties 
  of series circuits and ohm's law.

  // obtain the voltage from pin A0 to GND. This is also the voltage across our known reference resistor due to the layout of the circuit. 
  float VA0 = analogRead(A0)/204.6; // since we don't need to remember the bit value of the pin for later use, directly convert this bit value into a decimal voltage. 
  // because the known resistor and the unknown resistors are in series, the supply voltage of 5V is split across them. 
  // Therefore, the voltage across the unknown resistor only is equal to the difference between the 5V supply and the voltage across the known resistor. 
  float Vresistor = 5.0 - VA0; 
  // Since the circuit uses a 1kOhm resistor as the fixed reference resistance value, we simply divide the voltage across this known resistor by 1000 to obtain the current through BOTH resistors.  
  float Iresistor = VA0 / 1000; 
  // finally, using ohm's law with the determined voltage and current of the unknown resistor, we calculate the resistance of the unknown resistor.
